# HackerRank Problem Solving Practice

In an attempt to keep the mind thinking algorithmically, I try my best to complete at least one HackerRank problem a day.
If I find one to be rather simple I might increase the amount of problems I do that day depending on my schedule.
Any problem that I might find difficult, I work on for as long as my patience allows- then I take a break and come back
and try again. If by day 2 I am stuck on the same problem and have not yet come to a working solution to the problem,
then I will look for help online. From there, I will study it to truly understand why that solution works and I will 
look for any neat tricks in that solution that might help me with my coding/problem solving skills.
